# Bone-Fracture-Detection
The experiment has been performed on the bone X –ray image datasets, collected from different sources which are publicly available for research such as Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST). Project aims to develop a robust and automated system for bone fracture detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs).
